# SMS Sending Script

## Description

I'm currently working as a marketer.  One of my jobs it to send emails to potential voters via an sms control panel.  Basically I sit and click a send button about 10,000 times over the course of two hours.  It's not as bad as it sounds.  I love it actually.  I decided to automate it with selenium just to try out the feature. 

# Requirements

* Python 3
* Selenium
* Chrome Browser
* Chromedriver (http://chromedriver.chromium.org/)


# Environment Setup

* Put your email address and password in credentials.json file

* Now run pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to run it

    
    python3 sms_automation.py
